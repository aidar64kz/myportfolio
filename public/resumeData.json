    "bio": "Software Developer with a strong knowledge of modern web technologies. Looking to be part of a team that is passionate about solving interesting problems. My strengths are JS (ES5 and higher) and JS technologies (React, Node). After 4 years of administrative positions in 2020 I decided to change my career towards software development. During that time, I was able to develop a strong foundation on how to work efficiently solo and most importantly as a team. Always interested in expanding my horizons, new challenges, and getting my hands dirty with different technology stacks.",
